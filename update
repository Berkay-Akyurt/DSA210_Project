We started off by loading the Pokédex CSVs and then building up a handful of “battle‐relevant” features: total base‐stats and attack/defense ratios, average move‐power by each Pokémon’s primary and secondary types, and average physical‐move power for its primary type. With those in hand, we dove into exploratory plots (histograms of type‐power, scatter plots of total‐stat vs. type‐power, speed vs. type‐power, and attack vs. physical‐power) plus a big primary‐vs.‐secondary type heatmap to see which type combos are most common. Finally, we wrapped it all up with three clean hypothesis tests—Spearman correlations checking whether total_stat, speed, and attack really line up with our derived power metrics—and interpreted each p-value right in the code. All of this gives us a clear picture of which stats and move‐power metrics actually move together, laying a pretty good groundwork for the battle simulator to follow.
