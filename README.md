# Pokémon Battle Simulation – DSA210Project

## Project Overview
In this project, I will explore how the attributes and moves of Pokémon influence the outcomes of battles. By analyzing a dataset of Pokémon attributes (such as HP, Attack, Speed, and Defense) and their available moves, I aim to build a machine learning model that simulates battles and predicts outcomes based on Pokémon stats and strategies. 

The plan is to:

1. **Analyze** the Pokémon dataset to understand relationships between stats and battle outcomes.
2. **Simulate** battles based on attributes and predict the winner using machine learning algorithms.
3. **Develop insights** about how specific stats or moves affect battle performance.

## Objectives
1. **Understand Battle Influencers**  
   Investigate how Pokémon stats (Attack, Defense, Speed, etc.) and move effectiveness contribute to determining the outcome of a battle.

2. **Simulate Battles Using Data**  
   Develop a simplified system to simulate battles between Pokémon by incorporating their stats and available moves.

3. **Predict Battle Outcomes**  
   Train a machine learning model to predict the winner of a battle based on Pokémon attributes, moves, and types.

4. **Apply Data Science Skills**  
   Use Python and machine learning tools to analyze and simulate Pokémon battles, demonstrating real-world applications of data science techniques.

## Motivation
- **Personal Interest:** I wanted a data science project on something entertaining yet challenging—Pokémon battles felt like the perfect balance.  
- **Deeper Data Understanding:** I want to discover which Pokémon stats and moves matter most in battle outcomes and how this helps in competitive play.  
- **Real-World Application:** Applying machine learning to battle simulations can translate to broader gaming analytics.  
- **Long-Term Impact:** By the end, I’ll better understand both data science and game mechanics, which can help with future projects (and maybe give me an edge in actual battles!).

## Dataset
I’m using the [Full Pokémon and Moves Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thiagoamancio/full-pokemons-and-moves-datasets?select=metadata_pokemon.csv). It includes:
- **Pokémon Attributes:**
  - Name  
  - Base stats (Attack, Defense, Speed, HP, Special Attack, Special Defense)  
  - Type(s)  
  - Evolutions (if applicable)
- **Moves:**
  - Move names  
  - Move power, accuracy, and type  
  - Physical, special, or status classification  
  - PP (Power Points)

These details form the basis for understanding how attributes and moves synergize in battle.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python** for data cleaning, preprocessing, and building ML models  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization  
- **An ML Algorithm** (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) for predictive modeling  
- **NumPy** for numerical operations  

---

## Analysis Plan
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**  
   - Load and preprocess the dataset with Pandas  
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and ensure consistency  

2. **Data Exploration**  
   - Visualize distributions of Pokémon stats  
   - Analyze type advantages and win rates across different matchups  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create features like total stat sums, type effectiveness, and move effectiveness  
   - Combine attacker and defender attributes in battle simulations  

4. **Battle Simulation**  
   - Simulate 1v1 battles considering stats, moves, and type advantages  
   - Calculate damage based on Attack, move power, and type multipliers  

5. **Modeling**  
   - Train ML models to predict the winner of a matchup  
   - Evaluate performance with accuracy and other classification metrics  
   - Use statistical methods to compare move and stat effectiveness

## Example Analysis
As an illustration, consider a battle between **Charizard** (Fire/Flying) and **Blastoise** (Water). Key factors include:
- Stats: Attack, Speed, HP
- Move Effectiveness: Fire vs. Water  
- Type Advantage: Water is super effective against Fire

We can:
- Plot a scatter of Attack vs. Win/Loss outcome  
- Create a heatmap of win rates by type matchup  

---

## Conclusion
By the end of this project, I hope to answer:

- Which Pokémon stats most strongly influence battle outcomes?  
- How do type matchups and move choices affect success?  
- Can ML models reliably predict battle winners based on stats and moves?

This project merges my love of Pokémon with data science, showcasing how machine learning can be applied to real-world (and fun!) simulations. I’m also excited to see if these insights help me win more battles in practice!
