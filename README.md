Pokémon Battle Simulation - DSA210Project
Project Overview
In this project, I will explore how the attributes and moves of Pokémon influence the outcomes of battles. By analyzing a dataset of Pokémon attributes (such as HP, Attack, Speed, and Defense) and their available moves, I aim to build a machine learning model that simulates battles and predicts the outcomes based on Pokémon stats and strategies. The project will involve data exploration, feature engineering, and applying machine learning techniques to predict battle outcomes and gain insights into which factors contribute most to battle success.
The plan is to:
1. Analyze the Pokémon dataset to understand the relationships between stats and battle outcomes.
2. Simulate battles based on these attributes and predict the winner using machine learning algorithms.
3. Develop insights about how specific stats or moves affect battle performance.
Objectives
1. Understand Battle Influencers:  Look through how some Pokémon stats (Attack, Defense, Speed, etc.) and move effectiveness contribute to determining the outcome of a battle.
2. Simulate Battles Using Data:  Develop a simplified system to simulate battles between Pokémon by incorporating their stats and available moves.
3. Predict Battle Outcomes:  Train a machine learning model to predict the winner of a battle based on Pokémon attributes, moves, and types.
4. Apply Data Science Skills:  Use Python and machine learning tools to analyze and simulate Pokémon battles, demonstrating real-world applications of data science techniques.
Motivation
This project combines my interest in Pokémon and data science:
* Personal Interest: I wanted to do my data science project on something that I think would be both entertaining and challenging, so I thought that Pokemon Battles would be the perfect balance in between.
* Understanding Each Data Better: I want to uncover which Pokémon stats and moves make the biggest difference in battle outcomes. This could help players strategize better in competitive play.
* Real-World Application: I aim to apply machine learning to real-world scenarios like battle simulations, which could extend to gaming analytics and other competitive environments.
* Long-Term Impact: By the end of the project, I'll have a deeper understanding of both data science and game mechanics, which I can apply to future projects and challenges (and in my matches too).
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Full Pokémon and Moves Dataset, which includes two separate datasets, one that includes the Pokedex (the stats of all pokemon) and the other is the moveset dataset that's going to enable me to look into battles between pokemons.

Here are the contents:
* Pokémon Attributes:
    * Name
    * Base stats (Attack, Defense, Speed, HP, Special Attack, Special Defense)
    * Type(s)
    * Evolutions (if applicable) // This might be too complicated though
* Moves:
    * Move names
    * Move power, accuracy, and type
    * Whether a move is physical, special, or status-based
    * PP (Power Points) for each move
The dataset provides the foundation for understanding how Pokémon's attributes and moves work together in battle.
Tools and Technologies
For the analysis and battle simulation, I’ll rely on the following tools:
* Python: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and building machine learning models
* Pandas: For manipulating and analyzing the dataset
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizing relationships between attributes and battle outcomes
* An ML Algorithm: For implementing machine learning algorithms to predict battle outcomes
* NumPy: For numerical operations and handling large datasets
Analysis Plan
1. Data Collection and Cleaning
* Load and preprocess the dataset using Pandas.
* Handle missing values, duplicates, and standardize units across different Pokémon attributes and moves.
2. Data Exploration
* Visualize distributions of Pokémon stats (Attack, Defense, Speed) and the effectiveness of different types of moves using scatter plots, heatmaps, and bar charts.
* Analyze type advantages and how they affect battle outcomes by visualizing win rates between Pokémon of different types.
3. Feature Engineering
* Create features such as total stats (sum of all stats), type effectiveness, and move effectiveness.
* For each battle simulation, create a feature set including the attacking Pokémon’s stats, moves, and the opponent's stats and type.
4. Battle Simulation
* Simulate 1v1 Pokémon battles by considering both Pokémon’s stats, moves, and type advantages.
* Calculate damage dealt based on the Pokémon's attack, type effectiveness, and move power.
5. Modeling
* Train machine learning models to predict the winner of a battle based on Pokémon stats and move choices.
* Evaluate model performance using accuracy and other classification metrics.
* Use statistical to compare the effectiveness of different moves or stats.
Example Analysis
To illustrate, I’ll create a battle simulation where Pokémon A (e.g., Charizard) fights Pokémon B (e.g., Blastoise). The simulation will factor in:
* Stats (Attack, Speed, HP)
* Move Effectiveness (Fire vs. Water)
* Type Advantage (Fire is strong against Grass, Water is strong against Fire)
I’ll visualize the battle outcomes across various matchups and identify patterns in the Pokémon’s attributes or moves that consistently lead to success.
For example:
* A scatter plot could show the relationship between Attack and the battle outcome (win/loss).
* A heatmap might visualize how different types influence the win rate (e.g., Water Pokémon winning against Fire Pokémon).
Conclusion
By the end of this project, I hope to answer the following questions:
* Which Pokémon stats most strongly influence battle outcomes?
* How do type matchups and move choices affect battle success?
* Can machine learning models reliably predict battle winners based on Pokémon stats and moves?
This project will not only improve my understanding of Pokémon mechanics but also demonstrate how data science can be applied to game simulations and strategies. Since I play pokemon from time to time I actually want to use my finding in a real battle to see if I'm more successful in battles.
